# Description: mitmproxy is a console tool that allows interactive examination and modification of HTTP traffic. It differs from mitmdump in that all flows are kept in memory, which means that itâ€™s intended for taking and manipulating small-ish samples. Use the ? shortcut key to view, context-sensitive documentation from any mitmproxy screen.
