# Find files containing "foo", and print the line matches in context:
ag foo

# Find files containing "foo" in a specific directory:
ag foo path/to/directory

# Find files containing "foo", but only list the filenames:
ag -l foo

# Find files containing "FOO" case-insensitively, and print only the match, rather than the whole line:
ag -i -o FOO

# Find "foo" in files with a name matching "bar":
ag foo -G bar

# Find files whose contents match a regular expression:
ag '^ba(r|z)$'

# Find files with a name matching "foo":
ag -g foo

# To see a list of all supported file types, use the following command.
ag  --list-file-types

#This example shows how to recursively search for all scripts that contain the word "root" under the directory ~/bin/.
ag root ./bin/

# To print the filenames matching PATTERN and the number of matches in each file, other than the number of matching lines, use the -c switch as shown.
ag -c root ./bin/

# To match case-sensitively, add the -s flag as shown.
ag -cs ROOT ./bin/
ag -cs root ./bin/

# To print statistics of of a search operation such as files scanned, time taken, etc., use the the --stats option.
ag -c root --stats ./bin/

# The -w flag tells ag to only match whole words similar to grep command.
ag -w root ./bin/

# You can show column numbers in results using the --column option.
ag --column root ./bin/

# You can also use ag to search through purely text files, using the -t switch and the -a switch is used to search all types of files. In addition, the -u switch enables searching though all files, including hidden files.
ag -t root /etc/
ag -a root /etc/
ag -u root /etc/

# Ag also supports searching through the contents of compressed files, using the -z flag.
ag -z root wondershaper.gz

# You can also enable following of symbolic links (symlinks in short) with the -f flag.
ag -tf root /etc/ 

# By default, ag searches 25 directories deep, you can set the depth of the search using the --depth switch, for example.
ag --depth 40 -tf root /etc/
