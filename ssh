# To ssh via pem file (which normally needs 0600 permissions):
ssh -i /path/to/file.pem user@example.com

# To connect on an non-standard port:
ssh -p 2222 user@example.com

# To connect and forward the authentication agent
ssh -A user@example.com

# To execute a command on a remote server:
ssh -t user@example.com 'the-remote-command'

# To tunnel an x session over SSH:
ssh -X user@example.com

# Redirect traffic with a tunnel between local host (port 8080) and a remote
# host (remote.example.com:5000) through a proxy (personal.server.com):
ssh -f -L 8080:remote.example.com:5000 user@personal.server.com -N

# To launch a specific x application over SSH:
ssh -X -t user@example.com 'chromium-browser'

# To create a SOCKS proxy on localhost and port 9999
ssh -D 9999 user@example.com

# -X use an xsession, -C compress data, "-c blowfish" use the encryption blowfish
ssh user@example.com -C -c blowfish -X

# Imagine you’re on a private network which doesn’t allow connections to a specific server. Let’s say you’re at work and imgur.com is being blocked. To get around this we can create a tunnel through a server which isn’t on our network and thus can access Imgur.
ssh -L 9000:imgur.com:80 user@example.com

# Remote port forwarding
# Say that you’re developing a Rails application on your local machine, and you’d like to show it to a friend. Unfortunately your ISP didn’t provide you with a public IP address, so it’s not possible to connect to your machine directly via the internet.
# We’ll tell SSH to make a tunnel that opens up a new port on the server, and connects it to a local port on your machine.
ssh -R 9000:localhost:3000 user@example.com

# There is one more thing you need to do to enable this. SSH doesn’t by default allow remote hosts to forwarded ports. To enable this open /etc/ssh/sshd_config and add the following line somewhere in that config file.
# GatewayPorts yes
# Make sure you add it only once!
# $ sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# And restart SSH
# $ sudo service ssh restart
