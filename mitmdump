# Description: mitmdump is the command-line companion to mitmproxy. It provides tcpdump-like functionality to let you view, record, and programmatically transform HTTP traffic. See the --help flag output for complete documentation.

# Saving traffic
mitmdump -w outfile

# Filtering saved traffic
mitmdump -nr infile -w outfile "~m post"

# Client replay
mitmdump -nc outfile

# Start mitmdump without binding to the proxy port (-n), then replay all requests from outfile (-c filename). Flags combine in the obvious way, so you can replay requests from one file, and write the resulting flows to another:
mitmdump -nc srcfile -w dstfile

# Running a script
mitmdump -s examples/add_header.py

# Scripted data transformation
mitmdump -ns examples/add_header.py -r srcfile -w dstfile
