# find markdown files on _docs folder

# find file with kubernetes prefix on ~/Documents

# find files and execute command
# Using fd with xargs
# Count lines number of markdown files on current directory.
fd -e md -d 1 | xargs wc -l

# Recursively find all zip archives and unpack them:
# If there are two such files, `file1.zip` and `backup/file2.zip`, this would execute
# `unzip file1.zip` and `unzip backup/file2.zip`. The two `unzip` processes run in parallel
# (if the files are found fast enough).
fd -e zip -x unzip

# Find all `*.h` and `*.cpp` files and auto-format them inplace with `clang-format -i`:
fd -e h -e cpp -x clang-format -i

# Find all `test_*.py` files and open them in your favorite editor:
fd -g 'test_*.py' -X vim

# To see details like file permissions, owners, file sizes etc., you can tell `fd` to show them
# by running `ls` for each result:
fd â€¦ -X ls -lhd --color=always

# The `-X` option is also useful when combining `fd` with [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/) (`rg`) in order to search within a certain class of files, like all C++ source files:
fd -e cpp -e cxx -e h -e hpp -X rg 'std::cout'

# Convert all `*.jpg` files to `*.png` files:
fd -e jpg -x convert {} {.}.png
