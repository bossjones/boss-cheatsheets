# The jcmd utility is used to send diagnostic command requests to the JVM
# where these requests are useful for controlling Java Flight Recordings, troubleshoot, and diagnose JVM and Java Applications

# Print full HotSpot and JDK version ID
jcmd <process id/main class> VM.version

# Print all the system properties set for a VM
# There can be several hundred lines of information displayed.
jcmd <process id/main class> VM.system_properties

# Print all the flags used for a VM
# Even if you have provided no flags, some of the default values will be printed, for example initial and maximum heap size.
jcmd <process id/main class> VM.flags

# Print the uptime in seconds
jcmd <process id/main class> VM.uptime

# Create a class histogram
# The results can be rather verbose, so you can redirect the output to a file. Both internal and application specific classes are included in the list. Classes taking the most memory are listed at the top, and classes are listed in a descending order.
jcmd <process id/main class> GC.class_histogram

# Create a heap dump (hprof dump)
# This is the same as using jmap -dump:file=<file> <pid>, but jcmd is the recommended tool to use.
jcmd GC.heap_dump filename=Myheapdump

# Create a heap histogram
# This is the same as using jmap -histo <pid>, but jcmd is the recommended tool to use.
jcmd <process id/main class> GC.class_histogram filename=Myheaphistogram

# Print all threads with stack traces
jcmd <process id/main class> Thread.print

# Start a recording
# For example, to start a 2-minute recording on the running Java process with the identifier 7060 and save it to myrecording.jfr in the current directory, use the following:
jcmd 7060 JFR.start name=MyRecording settings=profile delay=20s duration=2m filename=C:\TEMP\myrecording.jfr

# Check a recording
# The JFR.check diagnostic command checks a running recording. For example:
jcmd 7060 JFR.check

# Stop a recording
# The JFR.stop diagnostic command stops a running recording and has the option to discard the recording data. For example:
jcmd 7060 JFR.stop

# Dump a recording
# The JFR.dump diagnostic command stops a running recording and has the option to dump recordings to a file. For example:
jcmd 7060 JFR.dump name=MyRecording filename=C:\TEMP\myrecording.jfr
